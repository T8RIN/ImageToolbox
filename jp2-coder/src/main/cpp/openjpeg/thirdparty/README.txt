This directory contains 3rd party libs (PNG, ZLIB)...

They are convinient copy of code from people outside of the OpenJPEG community.
They are solely provided for ease of build of OpenJPEG on system where those
3rd party libs are not easily accessible (typically non-UNIX).

The OpenJPEG does not recommend using those 3rd party libs over your system
installed libs. The OpenJPEG does not even guarantee that those libraries will
work for you.
